        PCB Redesign

                I was primarily hired by JPL as a summer intern to assist in the redesign of a quadruple mass spectrometer power board as shown.
                <br>
                <br>
                The previous version of the board was created in a hurry and, as a result, did not properly function due to the comibnation of high voltage <b>(3kV)</b> and improper routing and 
                component selection. My job was to use <b><u>Altium Designer</u></b> to create a new PCB.
                <br>
                <br>
                As you can see, the updated board has a much different layout in addition to the completely different
                components. The board was successfully assembled and tested and is currently being used at JPL in a testbed.

                Additionally, a small add-on board was suggested which I quickly put together after completely the primary board. This board features a basic linear voltage regulator
                to supply 5v to a display, and at the bottom of the board, there is also a voltage divider to scale down the 3kV so that it can be easily measured.
